# CTCH 499 Capstone-Project: Arduino based Animatronic Character
## Description

For my capstone project, I decided to create a very basic animatronic utilizing my skills with the Arduino Uno as well as my love of crafting and recycled materials. 
I have always been inspired by the ingenuity of Disney Imagineers, as well as the "Maker" style of creations I have seen through the show "Mythbusters" and on YouTube channels such and "[Evan and Katelyn](https://www.youtube.com/@EvanAndKatelyn)". I decided to base the design of my animatronic off of the Muppets as they have a simplistic puppet design that can be accomplished with easy to locate supplies, and don't necessarily focus on perfection. Based on my artistic skills, I knew I wouldn't be able to make something that looks realistic necessarily, but something fun and silly like a muppet felt like and achievable goal.

Through the process of my project's creation, I tested the limits of myself and my Arduino Uno that I was working with. I learned, often the hard way, that I was a bit too ambitious for the time allowed and power provided by one Arduino, so I had to break the construction and code down to simple steps that could each be executed individually before slowly combining and testing everything together.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
- [Requirements and Materials](#requirements)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Requirements and Materials

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
