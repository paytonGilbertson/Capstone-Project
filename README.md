# CTCH 499 Capstone Project: Arduino based Animatronic
## Description

For my capstone project, I decided to create a very basic animatronic utilizing my skills with the Arduino Uno as well as my love of crafting and recycled materials. 
I have always been inspired by the ingenuity of Disney Imagineers, as well as the "Maker" style of creations I have seen through the show "Mythbusters" and on YouTube channels such and "[Evan and Katelyn](https://www.youtube.com/@EvanAndKatelyn)". I decided to base the design of my animatronic off of the Muppets as they have a simplistic puppet design that can be accomplished with easy to locate supplies, and don't necessarily focus on perfection. Based on my artistic skills, I knew I wouldn't be able to make something that looks realistic necessarily, but something fun and silly like a muppet felt like and achievable goal.

Through the process of my project's creation, I tested the limits of myself and my Arduino Uno that I was working with. I learned, often the hard way, that I was a bit too ambitious for the time allowed and power provided by one Arduino, so I had to break the construction and code down to simple steps that could each be executed individually before slowly combining and testing everything together.
